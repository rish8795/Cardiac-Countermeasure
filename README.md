Following the religion of altruism for my final year major project, I worked as a team leader on building a web application “Cardiac Countermeasure”. As the name suggest this application’s main aim is intended to provide percentage chances of occurrence of heart attack using artificial intelligence. System will ask some relevant question to users and based on answer given by user it will give final system report giving user its percentage chances of occurrence of heart attack. based on the risk factor of heart-attack, system will also suggest user which laboratory test need to be conducted by them. apart form that user can also take lab appointment for conducting test and their reports will be directly uploaded in their profile. user can also take cardiologist appointment form the system itself. We have work with a team of 5 cardiologist lead by Dr. Sandarbh patel in assessing all data which we have taken from American Heart Association(AHA) for developing our custom algorithm for heart attack detection.
